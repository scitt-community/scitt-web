# The SCITT Community

The SCITT Community, the people behind this website and its efforts, are volunteers passionate about not only the [IETF SCITT standards](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/){:target="_blank"} but a variety of supply chain and transparency technologies.

## The IETF SCITT Working Group

The IETF Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust Working Group is the group of volunteers who formally maintain the [SCITT Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/){:target="_blank"}, the [SCITT Reference API](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scitt-scrapi/){:target="_blank"}, and other draft specifications and finalized standards for the scope of work defined in [its current charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/about/){:target="_blank"}.

## Getting Involved

### The SCITT Community

There are multiple ways to involve yourself in our community:

- Create issues, request code changes on pull requests, or comment on them [in our GitHub repos](https://github.com/scitt-community/){:target="_blank"}.
- Join [our groups.io mailing list](https://groups.io/g/scitt-community){:target="_blank"}, give feedback on the email threads of others, or start your very own.
- Attend our bi-weekly community meetings to discuss a variety of topics, ask questions, and better understand where your interests intersect with the group. We [meet online](https://meet.google.com/rek-mbak-nxv){:target="_blank"} every two weeks at [16:00 UTC](https://time.is/compare/300PM_5_June_2024_in_UTC/Tokyo/California/New_York/London){:target="_blank"} and more information can be found in our [online iCalendar feed](/assets/schedule.ics).
